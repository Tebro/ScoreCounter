The easiest way to get started with Foundation + Compass.

## Requirements

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [compass](http://compass-style.org/): `gem install compass`
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `npm install bower -g`

## Quickstart

Once you have all the dependencies installed run the following.
